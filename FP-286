                <h3>Who is Mohamed Bazoum ? </h3>

                    He has held several ministerial posts, notably that of Minister of the Interior from April 2016 to June 2020 and Minister of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs for Cooperation from 2011 to 2015. He was also elected four times as a deputy (1993 , 2004, 2011 and 2016) from the special constituency of Tesker (Zinder) and several times Vice-President of the National Assembly and President of the PNDS-Tarayya parliamentary group.

                <h3>Political beginnings</h3>
                <p>Bazoum became a founding member of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) in 1990, along with Mahamadou Issoufou. Bazoum served      election held on 11 April 1993; this followed the cancellation of the initial election in Tesker, held in February.
                   After the January 1995 parliamentary election, which was won by an opposition coalition of the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD) and the PNDS, Bazoum became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in the government of Prime Minister Hama Amadou, named on 25 February 1995. He was initially reappointed to that post after Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara seized power in a military coup on 27 January 1996, but he was replaced in the government named on 5 May 1996. The PNDS opposed Maïnassara, and on 26 July 1996, Bazoum was placed under house arrest along with PNDS President Mahamadou Issoufou, a few weeks after the 1996 presidential election. He and Issoufou were released on the orders of a judge on 12 August 1996.
                   Bazoum was arrested along with two other major opposition politicians, including MNSD Secretary-General Hama Amadou, in early January 1998, for allegedly participating in a plot to assassinate Maïnassara. He was never charged and was released a week after his arrest.At the Fourth Ordinary Congress of the PNDS, held on 4 - 5 September 2004, Bazoum was elected as its Vice-President. Bazoum was again elected to the National Assembly in the December 2004 parliamentary election, and during the parliamentary term that followed he was Third Vice-President of the National Assembly and Vice-President of the PNDS Parliamentary Group.Bazoum was one of 14 deputies who filed a censure motion against Prime Minister Hama Amadou on 26 May 2007; Amadou's government was defeated in the subsequent no-confidence vote on 31 May, and Bazoum praised the "maturity of the political class of Niger that has just put an end to the mandate of the team which specialised in the predation of public funds."  
                   After urging the people to boycott the August 2009 constitutional referendum, Bazoum was briefly detained and questioned for two hours on 14 July 2009. Bazoum was re-elected as PNDS Vice-President at the party's Fifth Ordinary Congress, held on 18 July 2009. Following the success of the referendum, he characterized it as a "coup d'etat" and said that the October 2009 parliamentary election was an "electoral farce" intended merely to add a "democratic polish".
